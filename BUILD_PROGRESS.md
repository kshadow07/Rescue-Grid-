## Phase 7 — Post-Polish Fixes (2026-04-04)

### Issues Fixed:
- [x] **Chat input bar missing** — Added `z-50` and safe-area-inset-bottom padding to fixed input bar

- [x] **Map WebGL container warning** — Added check for childNodes.length > 0 before initializing map
- [x] **Volunteer layout missing** — Recreated `app/(volunteer)/layout.tsx` with status bar, active mission strip, and bottom nav
- [x] **Missing Volunteer API routes** — Created all 6 missing volunteer API routes:
  - `GET /api/volunteer/assignment` — get active assignment
  - `GET /api/volunteer/assignment/queue` — queue assignments
  - `GET /api/volunteer/assignment/history` — completed/failed assignments
  - `GET /api/volunteer/assignment/active` — active assignment
  - `PATCH /api/volunteer/assignment/[id]` — update status
  - `PATCH /api/volunteer/location` — update GPS coordinates
  - `GET/POST /api/volunteer/message` — fetch/send TF messages

## Technical Notes

- Stack: Next.js 16.2.2 (App Router) · Supabase · Mapbox GL JS · PWA · Vercel
- Package Manager: Bun only (never npm/npx/yarn)
- Tailwind CSS v4 — uses CSS-based `@theme` configuration in globals.css
- Project location: `rescuegrid/` subdirectory
- Next.js 16 uses `proxy.ts` convention (middleware warning present but build passes)
- Database: 7 tables with circular FK (task_force ↔ assignment) resolved via ALTER TABLE

### Auth Architecture (REFACTORED)
- **DMA Auth:** Supabase Auth email/password → `sb-access-token` / `sb-refresh-token` cookies
- **Volunteer Auth:** Custom demo mode → `volunteer_session` cookie (JSON with volunteer_id, phone, name)
  - No Twilio/SMS dependency
  - Validates phone against `volunteer.mobile_no` in DB
  - Cookie is httpOnly, secure in production, 7-day expiry
  - **⚠️ Future:** When ready for real OTP, enable Twilio in Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → Providers → Phone.
